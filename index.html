           Hi, I'm Audrey ðŸ‘‹
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>
           Currently, I'm a product manager at <a href="https://www.guild.com/">Guild Education</a> enabling education pathways for America's workforce.
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>
           Previously, I led multiple software teams to release one of the first physician sponsored DNA health tests called <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200803005219/en/Ancestry%C2%AE-Launches-AncestryHealth%C2%AE-Powered-Generation-Sequencing-NGS">AncestryHealth</a>.
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>
           Back in 2018, I led and planned the release of <a href="https://blogs.ancestry.com/ancestry/2018/11/09/ancestry-launches-a-new-take-on-genetic-traits/">AncestryDNA Traits</a>.
