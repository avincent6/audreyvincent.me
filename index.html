           Hi, I'm Audrey.
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>
           Currently, I am working as a product manager for backend teams that power <a href="https://www.ancestry.com/corporate/newsroom/press-releases/introducing-ancestryhealth-actionable-health-insights-you-and-your-family">AncestryHealth</a>.
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>
           Together, we released one of the first physician sponsored DNA health tests using <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3841808/#:~:text=Next%20generation%20sequencing%20(NGS)%2C,sequenced%20within%20a%20single%20day.">Next Generation Sequencing</a>. Go check out our new product <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200803005219/en/Ancestry%C2%AE-Launches-AncestryHealth%C2%AE-Powered-Generation-Sequencing-NGS">AncestryHealth powered by NGS</a>.
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>
           Previously in 2018, I lead and planned the release of <a href="https://blogs.ancestry.com/ancestry/2018/11/09/ancestry-launches-a-new-take-on-genetic-traits/">AncestryDNA Traits</a> as a product owner.
