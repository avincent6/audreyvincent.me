           Hi, I'm Audrey ðŸ‘‹
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>
           I'm a product manager with 4 years of experience leading software teams and launching products backed by user research. 
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>
          Last fall, I took time off to help my partner open a new restaurant called <a href="https://www.tosswoodfired.com/">Toss Wood Fired</a>. Currently, I'm working part-time at <a href="https://www.amerlightenergy.com/">Amerlight Energy</a>, building utility-scale renewable energy storage systems.
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>
          Previously, I owned a B2B2C admissions marketplace at <a href="https://www.guild.com/">Guild Education</a>, a company that provides free education benefits for employees at Walmart, Target, Lowes, etc. At Ancestry, I launched two B2C genetic products called <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200803005219/en/Ancestry%C2%AE-Launches-AncestryHealth%C2%AE-Powered-Generation-Sequencing-NGS">AncestryHealth</a>, a DNA test that provides preventative health insights and <a href="https://blogs.ancestry.com/ancestry/2018/11/09/ancestry-launches-a-new-take-on-genetic-traits/">AncestryDNA Traits</a>, 30+ characteristics based on DNA.
